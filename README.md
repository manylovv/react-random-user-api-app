# hi there!

In this repository I went through this react coding interview: [youtube.com/watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s0OVdoo4Q4&ab_channel=BenAwad)

My app takes 10 random users from [randomuser.me/api](randomuser.me) and displays location of each user in the table.

When you click on the table header, content in this column sorts either descending or ascending order

To run this code locally:

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:manylovv/react-user-api.git

cd react-user-api

# install dependencies:
npm install

# run app at localhost:5173
npm run dev
```
